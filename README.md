# Classification-model

This project's objective is mainly to show how you can use LIME AND SHAP LIBRARIES in the interpretabililty of models(opening the black box)

we analyze the model and evaluate the relevance of potential features both on a global and a local level.

The dataset used is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution that were based on phone calls. Often more than one contact to the same client was required in order to access if the bank term deposit would be subscribed.

The classification model will predict whether the client will subscribe  to a term deposit. 

 Main interest of the whole project is to find out how a classification model can lead to certain decision.
